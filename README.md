# Personal Finance Insights

## Project Overview
This project analyzes aggregate level expenses and savings data to provide actionable insights into spending patterns, savings behavior, and financial efficiency. The analysis helps in identifying areas of improvement, optimizing expenses, and ensuring individuals meet their desired savings targets.

## Problem Statement
The key objectives of this project are:

1. **Analyze Total Expenses & Savings by City and Occupation**  
   Understand how expenses and savings vary across different cities and occupations.

2. **Segment Population by Age Groups & Calculate Average Spending per Category and % of Total Expenses**  
   Identify spending patterns across age groups and measure category-wise expense contribution.

3. **Identify Individuals Not Meeting Desired Savings Targets**  
   Highlight individuals whose actual savings are below the expected target.

4. **Compare Actual Expenses vs Potential Savings in Groceries and Transport**  
   Pinpoint areas where potential savings can be realized in essential spending categories.

5. **Calculate Necessities vs Discretionary Spending Ratios**  
   Analyze spending distribution between essential needs and discretionary items to understand financial behavior.
